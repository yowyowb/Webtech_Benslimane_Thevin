*Welcome to our Webtech project Applicartion
It is an Application in React and Express
It is about a chat Application*

## Usage

*how to start and use the application, run the tests, ...*

* Clone the project and install the dependencies with the following commands in your terminal

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yowyowb/Webtech_Benslimane_Thevin
  cd Webtech_Benslimane_Thevin
  ```

* Install [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/getting-started/). For example, on Ubuntu, from your project root directory:   
  ```
  # Install Go
  apt install golang-go
  # Download Dex
  git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex.git
  # Build Dex
  cd dex
  make
  make examples
  ```
  Note, the provided `.gitignore` file ignore the `dex` folder.
* Make a copy of the Dex configuration to `./dex-config/config-private.yaml`, the project is configured to Git ignore this path:
  ```bash
  cp -rp ./dex-config/config.yaml ./dex-config/config-private.yaml
  ```
* Register your GitHub application, get the clientID and clientSecret from GitHub (GitHub/Setting/Developper Settings/OAuth Apps) and report them to your Dex configuration. Modify the provided `./dex-config/config-private.yaml` configuration to look like:
  ```yaml
  - type: github
    id: github
    name: GitHub
    config:
      clientID: xxxx98f1c26493dbxxxx
      clientSecret: xxxxxxxxx80e139441b637796b128d8xxxxxxxxx
      redirectURI: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/callback
  ```
* Inside `./dex-config/config-private.yaml`, the frond-end application is already registered and CORS is activated. Now that Dex is built and configured, your can start the Dex server:
  ```yaml
  cd dex
  bin/dex serve ../dex-config/config-private.yaml
  ```
* Start the back-end
  ```bash
  cd back-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  # Optional, fill the database with initial data
  bin/init
  # Start the back-end
  bin/start
  ```
* Start the front-end
  ```bash
  cd front-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  # Start the front-end
  yarn start
  ```

## Tasks

* Git and DevOps   
  *We used Git and its tools to do this project, we used many commits and we used the pull request tool. We try to organize our branches by folder (feature).*

Application development

* Welcome screens

If the user does not yet exist in the database, he is created automatically.*
